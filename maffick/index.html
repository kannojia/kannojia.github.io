				            <p>Singing is a tranquil river of emotions which emanates from a singer's soul and ends up resting in the hearts of listeners. As spoken by the maestro Rabindranath Tagore himself, "God respects me when I work ; but God loves me when I sing". Music is a powerful instrument to convey one's emotions whether they be violent or calm, passionate or apathetic, un-yearning or abjuring. For some it is a matter of sheer devotion, for some it is a pilgrimage and for some it is an unparalleled way of expression. Everyone has it somewhere deep inside the heart to perform live on a stage in front of a roaring audience! So wake up and grab the chance to rock the stage with your exhilarating performances. Come and indulge  yourself in the world of music because the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye. We welcome all those for whom singing is not only a passion but their first love, the secret of their energy. We invite those who find music to be like finding their souls and those who love to see audiences enjoying with them. If you have that fire within you, come to this garden of musical notes - "SWARAANGAN".</p><br>

				        		Style, they say, is a way to say who you are without having to speak. In fact, life is a fashion show and the world is its runway. Fashion is interwoven into the very social fabric of our societal culture. So much so that today no speck of human life remains untouched with fashion.<br>
				        		It is your sartorial signature that casts your ‘first impression’ and perhaps an impression that lasts long.<br>
				        		MANIT, an institute of national importance that is, has aced all domains, and fashion is no exception. The annual cultural fest of MANIT, Maffick, brings you an opportunity to amalgamate your talent, your spontaneity, your confidence, your sartorial taste and your attitude with your fashion sense, and bring the amalgam to the ramp of “Mr and  Miss Maffick”. <br>

					        We plan to organise a gaming event in maffick-2k15. The game would be fifa-14/15 (15 if possible) one of the most famous pc and play station games across the globe. We plan to promote the event using the website of maffick as well as by means of posters and we would do verbal promotion as well. We plan to conduct the event on play stations(if possible)/laptops (of our own) that is laptops which are having good specifications and the game would run lag free. I hope that the web designing team includes our event on maffick website for online registration of the event. On clicking the link the person would be redirected to a google  docs form.<br><br>

					        <strong>ROUNDS:</strong>
					        In prelims the players will have to play against a particular difficulty level or among themselves which totally depends on the number of registrations we get. In round 2 there will be matches between people who do well in the prelims, which would be followed by round-3 and then finals.<br><br>

					        <p>
					        <strong>Tambola Tickets</strong>
					        As a rule, each player must buy at least one ticket to enter a game. A typical 90 ball Tambola ticket consists of 3 rows and 9 columns which make 27 spaces. Each row has a total of 5 numbers printed on it(in our case some clues of movies). A column can have 1, 2 or the maximum3 clues printed on it. <br><br>

					        <strong>Gameplay</strong>
					        The objective of the game is to mark/ dab all the names/clues found in the ticket as called by the dealer/host. The player who first mark all the names /clues in a winning pattern and calls a win is declared as the WINNER of that pattern after the dealer/host  checks his ticket and verify it with names drawn.<br><br>

					        If your claimed winning pattern is wrong, it will be called BOOGY and you cannot continue the game i.e.  You are disqualified.<br><br>

					        The game ends when all 90 clues are drawn, or when a winner is declared for all the patterns of the game, whichever comes first.<br><br>

					        <strong>Tambola Winning Patterns</strong>
					        In order to win in Tambola or Bingo, you need to match winning combinations. Some of the popular winning combinations in a Tambola game are given below:<br><br>

					        <b>Top Line:</b> The ticket with all the names of the top row dabbed fastest.<br>
					        <b>Middle Line:</b> The ticket with all the names of the middle row dabbed fastest.<br>
					        <b>Bottom Line:</b> The ticket with the names of the bottom row dabbed fasted.<br>
					        <b>Full House:</b> The ticket with all the 15 numbers marked first.<br>
